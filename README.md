Problem Statement
Banks face challenges in processing loan applications due to manual approvals, lack of real-time
credit evaluation, and high chances of risk misclassification. This causes delays, errors, and
compliance issues, reducing customer satisfaction and increasing operational risks.

Proposed Salesforce Solution
The solution leverages Salesforce CRM to automate and streamline the loan application and risk
categorization process. It integrates with external credit score APIs, introduces multi-level approval
workflows, and provides real-time dashboards to track loan performance and risk categories. This
ensures faster decisions, better compliance, and improved customer experience.
